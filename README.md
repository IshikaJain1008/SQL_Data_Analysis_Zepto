# 📊 SQL Data Analysis Project – Zepto Dataset

*Overview:*

This repository contains a collection of SQL queries written in PostgreSQL to analyze a product-level dataset.
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate practical SQL skills used in real-world data analytics, including filtering, aggregation, grouping, and insight generation.

*Dataset:*
Dataset name: Zepto Product Dataset

Format: CSV

Granularity: Product-level data

*Key attributes include:*

1.Product category and name

2.Pricing (MRP, discounted price, discount %)

3.Stock availability and quantity

4.Product weight

The dataset was first cleaned and prepared before being queried in PostgreSQL.

*Tools Used:*

1.PostgreSQL – Query execution and analysis

2.SQL – Data extraction and insight generation

*Analysis Covered:*

The SQL queries in this file focus on:

1.Category-wise product analysis

2.Price and discount-based insights

3.Stock availability and out-of-stock analysis

4.ggregations using GROUP BY

5.Filtering using WHERE and HAVING clauses

6.Sorting and ranking results for better interpretation

7..These queries are designed to answer business-relevant questions and simulate real analytics use cases.

*File Description*
File Name	Description:
Zepto_Data_SQL_Analysis.sql	Contains all SQL queries used for data analysis

How to Use:

1.Create a table in PostgreSQL using the dataset schema

2.Load the CSV data into the table

3.Open Zepto_Data_SQL_Analysis.sql in pgAdmin or any SQL editor

4.Run queries sequentially to explore insights

*Learning Outcome:*

This project helped strengthen my understanding of:
1.Writing clean and readable SQL queries

2.Applying SQL for analytical problem-solving

3.Extracting insights from structured datasets
4.It reflects my preparation for entry-level Data Analyst roles.

*Notes:*
1.Queries are written specifically for PostgreSQL syntax
2.Column names follow snake_case conventions
